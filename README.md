- Increased FOV from 90 to 110 (120 max via Console "fov_desired 120")
- HUD Aspect Ratio (4:3, 16:9, 16:10)
- Vulkan renderer (-vulkan)
- Working Gamepad UI/Steam Deck UI (-gamepadui)
- Better controller support (Steam Input, untested)
- Customized Gamepad UI to have the images on "New Game" chapters matching the one from HL2 Update.
- and more...

Bug that are also fixed (by Valve), which also works with HL2 Update mod including:
- Dropship gun fix which now allows it to turn it's rifle.
- Long loading saves bug/engine freezing while saving has been fixed (caused by the game tries to access \\MOD, which freezes the engine).
- Fixed some stuttering on level transitions
- NPC eyes not blinking
- Missing Combine sounds has been fixed (noticeable by shooting them)
- and much more... (https://web.archive.org/web/20160830085422/http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1286478)
