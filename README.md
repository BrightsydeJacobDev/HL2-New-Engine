**IMPORTANT**, this mod was formerly called as "__Half-Life 2: Update++__", but decided to renamed it to "**Half-Life 2: reUpdate**" as it's was cooler.

# About this patch/mod

This is the patch for HL2 Update mod, which upgrades the outdated version of the Source engine to latest one came from vanilla game, while also adding new features:
- Increased FOV from 90 to 110 (120 max via Console "fov_desired 120")
- HUD Aspect Ratio (4:3, 16:9, 16:10)
- Vulkan renderer (-vulkan)
- Working Gamepad UI/Steam Deck UI (-gamepadui)
- Better controller support (Steam Input, untested)
- Customized Gamepad UI to have the images on "New Game" chapters matching the one from HL2 Update.
- and more...

Bug that are also fixed (by Valve), which also works with HL2 Update mod including:
Recently (Nov 17, 2023):
- Fixed a hang where NPC pathfinding could stall forever
- Fixed sprinting when using an external controller (This fix would be pointless with HL2 reUPDATE due to Steam Controller being unsupported anyway).
Previously:
- Dropship gun fix which now allows it to turn it's rifle.
- Long loading saves bug/engine freezing while saving has been fixed (caused by the game tries to access \\MOD, which freezes the engine).
- Fixed some stuttering on level transitions
- NPC eyes not blinking
- Missing Combine sounds has been fixed (noticeable by shooting them)
- and much more... (https://web.archive.org/web/20160830085422/http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1286478)
Technical info:
Current version: Source 2013, v24 - build 8491853, last updated in Nov 17, 2023. Custom version numbering was removed to avoid causing other issues.

This mod will get updates (as long i'm not dead or quit working on the project) when Valve releases a engine update for the vanilla game, which will be
quickly ported over to work with HL2 Update.
